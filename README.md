Simple inventory widget demonstration
A widget inventory has been created using inheritance of QTableWidget. For each cell of QTableWidget a basket is initiallized which holds items.
The inventory widget also connects to an sql database using sqlite library. The widget sends command after each inventory modification.

Apple generator widget was created the same way as the inventory, without drop acceptance functionality
